General design of PRF support:

1.  Make it as a separate module
2.  Read support first, write support second
3.  Present data in english or metric units
 -convert on the fly
 -API may pass spacing (preferred) or use interpolation to provide a model
 -MUST support custom spacing
4.  API must extract a list/array of valid pressures
 -Pressure can serve as a key

Little points:
Use a filehandle [caller open()s the file with mode rb]
Store data in a table!

Proposed API (roughly)
prffile=open('SOMEFILE.PRF',mode='rb')
prftarget=numpy.zeros(....)
while ERR==0
	try:
		ERR=prf.read(prffile,prftarget)
	except:	#End of file--read error
		break
