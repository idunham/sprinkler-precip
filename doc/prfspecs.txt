The program was developed almost 25 years ago so for various reasons, it's 
kind of goofy.  They are random length files of 500 characters for each 
record.  If you're familiar with Visual Basic, you should understand the 
code below.  If not, let me know.

The type def is below.  DL1 through DL19 are comma delimiters.  The 
catchment data is 61 five character strings of four characters representing 
the catchment data and a comma.  All the data is in ASCII strings.
The profile type is as follows:

1 = Standard profile in English units.

2 = Standard Profile in Metric units

4 = Special catchment spacing with English units

5 = Special catchment spacing with Metric units

Catchment data for types 1 and four are stored multiplied by 1000 and 2 and 
5 by 10.  They are the raw data so you need to use the test duration to 
convert them to inches per hour.  For profiles of type 4 or 5, you need to 
use this function to convert the catchment spacing:

Function CVS!(param$)
    Dim L%, M%

    M = Asc(Left(param, 1))
    L = Asc(Right(param, 1))
    CVS = (M * 256 + L) / 100
End Function

 Here is the Type Definition:

        Testf As String * 20 ' Test Facility
        DL1 As String * 1
