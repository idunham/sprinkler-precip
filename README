		Sprinkler Precipitation Modeler
Copyright (C) 2012 Isaac Dunham

Currently, there is one program that will take data on sprinkler 
precipitation and generate a graphical model of precipitation, 
given a specified sprinkler spacing.
The aforesaid program (SPACE/Hyper-SPACE/SPACE-Pro from Fresno State) 
is closed-source, available by purchase only, and also only supports 
Windows.  

Since I use Debian GNU/Linux, I want a *nix-compatible program; as a 
university student aiming for employment outside academia, I want gratis 
software; as a tinkerer who always wants to understand stuff, I want libre
software.  Additionally, I understand the advantages of FOSS in terms of
practical utility.

I hope to implement a free replacement for SPACE.  
It will probably get written in Python + NumPy, because it seems easy to me,
I understand Python better than anything else, and because NumPy appears to
handle the arrays I'll use decently.

ROADMAP
0.0*:
-Fill an array with depth data based on hard-coded table
-Generate array for multiple sprinklers in squares
0.1*:
-Input from file: CSV table for sprinkler deposition
-Output to file/stdout: graphics of multiple sprinklers
0.2*:
-Variable file names
-No data hardcoded
-Rectangular spacing?
0.3*:
-Add PRF support (SPACE sprinkler data)?
-Bugfixes
-UI changes?
-Add support for staggered/trianagular spacing?
1.0: should have all of above working well

Version 1 may be CLI only; a GUI (if it happens) may be Tkinter.

STATUS
Pseudocode has been written (see doc/overview).

0.01 implemented: fill array representing sprinkler precipitation with hardcoded input data

0.02 implemented: adding arrays works.
